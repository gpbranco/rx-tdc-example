Reactive Programming on Android - RxJava Example
==============

This repository contains the demo application used as an example of reactive programming on Android talk I gave on the [The Developer’s Conference - 2016](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br) in Florianópolis, SC. Here's the link to the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/guipbranco/reactive-programming-no-android).

## Goal

The main goal of this talk is to give a brief idea on what is reactive programming and how to transform existing implementations using AsyncTasks into a RxJava implementation.
